Introduction

 The Maven {{{http://maven.apache.org}http://maven.apache.org}} website is composed from:

 * a main content,

 * multiple components reference documentation, published for each component release.

 []

 Since December 2012, the overall website uses svnpubsub mechanism:
 the whole site content accessible at {{{http://maven.apache.org}http://maven.apache.org}} is stored
 in a dedicated site publication svn: {{https://svn.apache.org/repos/infra/websites/production/maven/content/}}.

 See {{{http://www.apache.org/dev/cms}CMS documentation}} for more information on the rationale behind the switch
 from "scp to people.apache.org + (find+rsync)" to svnpubsub.

How website publication works

 Instructions on how to publish website content are split in separate documents:

 * {{{./deploy-maven-website.html}deploying the main Maven website}},

 * {{{./deploy-component-reference-documentation.html}deploying Maven components reference documentation}}.

 []

 A {{{./website-overview.html}complete overview}} is available, assembling previous explanations.
